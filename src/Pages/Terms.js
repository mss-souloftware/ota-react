OTA has defined information security policy documentation that is available to our customers upon request. Our core principles for information security management rely on international security policy definitions that are adapted as necessary to the local situation for the following areas:

                                            OTA treats that all e-mails received and sent must be kept confidential and can only be accessed by the persons indicated in the e-mails.

                                            The e-mails services used by OTA meet the data security requirements of the business.

                                            OTA connects to the electronical mailboxes with a secure and recognized SSL / TLS protocol that ensures reliable information encryption. Also, electronical mailboxes are protected against spam.

                                        <p>
                                            All outgoing and incoming e-mails are encrypted, so there is a small possibility that it could be taken over by third parties.
